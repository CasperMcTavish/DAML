CPP_code obtains the C++ code for this project. To compile and run, please use the enviromentalSetup.sh then go through the normal steps.

This C++ code does what is required. Produces a new object behind the shield (a uranium box), then makes it a sensitive energy counter which creates histograms and ntuples, then I simulated 200 events for the lead shield and my own shield (made of bone).

The screenshot for the first question is in the base directory, titled 'seed_1234 muon collision'.

Lead Shield analysis code contains the two csv files and the python analysis code that produces the energy radio between the lead shield and the uranium box behind it

Bone Shield analysis code contains the two csv files and the python analysis code that produces the energy radio between the Bone shield and the uranium box behind it

Within the bone shield folder, a small text file discussing the changes comments on the differences.

For fun, the image 'BONE_SHIELD' is saved in the base directory, and shows the bone shield being useless at defending the uranium box behind it from the electron beam.

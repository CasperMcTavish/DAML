Data Analysis and Machine Learning

Storage of all my Data Analysis and Machine Learning code for the university of edinburgh course.

Projects are either labelled P or PROJECT

Checkpoints are labelled CP

Most of the projects and checkpoints are functional jupyter notebooks, with (hopefully) enough explanation to run through without issue, while understanding the goals of each CP
